(“long” and “short” refer to longhand and shorthand syntax and should give the same results. They’re simply different ways to declare your style rules, use at least one of each syntax. You must use both long and short hand notations for each of the following: margin, padding, border) 
Margin     /* spacing between html elements */
Long (margin-top, margin-bottom, margin-left, margin-right)
Short (margin: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>)
Auto margins: margin: auto

Long (padding-top, padding-bottom, padding-left, padding-right)
Short (padding: <top> <right> <bottom> <left>)
